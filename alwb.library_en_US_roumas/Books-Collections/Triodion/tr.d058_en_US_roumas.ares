Since He knows the future as though it were present, He has recorded for us the life of Lazarus and the Rich Man. So, let us reflect on the outcome of each; let us flee from the latter’s callousness and misanthropy, and strive after the former’s fortitude and patience, that we may join him in the comfort of Abraham’s bosom, shouting: “O just Judge, Lord, glory to You!”"
